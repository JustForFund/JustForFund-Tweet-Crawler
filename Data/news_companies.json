     </div>\n<div class=\"body field field-name-body field-label-hidden\">\n        <p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>PARTNER CONTENT</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>The boom in sustainable investing has brought challenges to the process of fundamental research. One of these key pressures is data-related, due to the fragmentation which still exists in this part of the market. Uniting datasets in one place can prove to be a very powerful tool for managers looking to make an impact in the ESG arena. More broadly, the market volatility has underlined the need for modern research management and financial research software.</strong></em></p>\n<p>\u201cFunds source and monitor ESG ratings from several 3rd party data providers but need to be able to review and monitor those datapoints in context with one another,\u201d outlines Andrew Robson, CEO, Verity, \u201cWe help them unite those datasets in one place with, for example, integrations with Sustainalytics, and others.\u201d</p>\n<p>Verity won the 2022 Hedgeweek US Award for Best Data Provider \u2013 Overall.</p>\n<p>Robson details another challenge in relation to ESG and data: \u201cThis is related to ESG engagement tracking and reporting. It\u2019s a matter of time before funds must disclose how sustainable they are. In July, we released VerityESG, a reporting and engagement tracker that gives asset managers an efficient way to build their engagement narrative and prove stewardship.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is particularly relevant given the growing need for funds to prove stewardship by tracking and reporting on engagements. Robson comments: \u201cUp until recently, these activities have been managed manually. It\u2019s slow and time intensive. As regulators in the U.S. are catching up, funds are realising they need to formalise how they tackle this.\u201d</p>\n<p>The VerityESG tool was launched specifically to help funds automate and streamline engagement tracking and reporting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The data provider also supports managers in tackling the ongoing talent wars and cementing of the new hybrid workplace.</p>\n<p>Robson comments: \u201cMany financial services IT and business decision-makers expect more than half of their workforce to reman hybrid after the pandemic. Further, most financial services business decision-makers believe hybrid work environments help them recruit top talent and remain competitive in the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFunds can\u2019t miss a step. Our cloud-based and mobile-friendly research management software enable funds to hire talent where it lives and then keep their teams connected \u2014 whether they are in New York City, Chicago, or Tokyo. In addition, a research management system that stores all a fund\u2019s research accelerates onboarding of incoming talent and protects against potential IP losses when talent leaves.\u201d</p>\n<p>While the volatility over the past year has had major impacts on markets, Verity\u2019s clients still must develop winning investment ideas and do so as quickly and efficiently as possible. In many ways, the fluidity of the current moment has only elevated the need for modern research management and financial research software, both of which help fund improve performance and build market resiliency.\u00a0</p>\n<hr /><p><span style=\"display: block; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #313131; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20px;\"><strong><img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"150\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/sites/default/files/Verity_Andrew_Robson_Index.png\" style=\"float: left;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"150\" /></strong></span><em><strong> Andrew Robson, CEO, Verity</strong></em></span></p>\n\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-newsletter-signup field-label-hidden\">\n              <div class=\"field-item\">Like this article? <a href=\"http://www.hedgeweek.com/user/register\">Sign up to our free newsletter</a></div>\n      </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-author-profile field-label-visually_hidden\">\n      <div class=\"field-label visually-hidden\">Author Profile</div>\n              <div class=\"field-item\"></div>\n      </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-content-channel field-label-above\">\n      <div class=\"field-label\">Related Topics</div>\n        <div class=\"field-items\">\n            <div class=\"field-item\"><a class=\"button hollow secondary\" href=\"http://www.hedgeweek.com/category/content-channels/solutions\" hreflang=\"en\">Solutions</a></div>\n          </div>\n  </div>", "pubDate": "Mon, 23 Jan 2023 13:56:36 +0000", "fuente": "Hedge Week", "sentiment": "positive"}], "PKI": [{"titulo": "Designing and building a privately hosted PKI", "link": "https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/designing-and-building-a-privately-hosted-pki", "summary": "Public Key Infrastructure -

Currently, investment managers with  holdings of US securities totaling $100 million or more are required to  file a 13F each quarter.&nbsp; The proposal seeks to increase that level 35x  to managers holding $3.5 billion or more. <br /><br /><b>The result?&nbsp; A 90% reduction in the number of 13Fs filed</b>.<b>&nbsp;  This would reduce the number of hedge funds that file from 800 down to  less than 100.&nbsp; It would decrease total filers from around 5,283 to a  mere 549. &nbsp; $2.3 trillion in investment holdings would no longer be  disclosed.</b></p><p>The proposal lays out the pros of making this change, so herein we'll examine the counterpoints to their arguments and the cons of making such a drastic change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There's also information at the bottom on how you can provide feedback to the SEC.&nbsp; <u>The deadline to submit comment is tomorrow (September 29th, 2020).</u><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\"><span>Counterpoints to the SEC's 13F Proposal</span></span><br /><br /><b>1) 13F Filing Costs For Managers Are Negligible</b><br /><br />The SEC's main rationale for the proposal is that it would provide  relief for smaller managers.&nbsp; It argues that smaller managers that would  no longer file 13Fs would save direct compliance costs that \"could  range from $15,000 to $30,000 annually per manager.\"<br /><br />One hedge fund told us that <i>at worst</i>  they see around $3,500 in costs per quarter to file a 13F, or around  $14,000 per year, just below the low-end of the SEC's estimates.&nbsp;  Another hedge fund noted that costs and time associated with filing 13Fs  are negligible.&nbsp; Any 'relief' that would fall to smaller managers is de minimis, at best.&nbsp;<br /><br />Examining a hypothetical scenario of firms currently most impacted  showcases this: a firm managing $100 million with only a 1% management  fee and no performance fee theoretically earns $1 million in revenue a year.&nbsp; Taking  the SEC's highest estimate of yearly filing costs ($30,000) and dividing  that by the firm's hypothetical yearly revenue ($1 million) means that  annual filing costs would be only 3% of revenue. <br /><br />And using the SEC's own estimates, that's <i>the worst</i> case scenario  since it's the smallest firm required to file a 13F.&nbsp; A $500 million  firm in the same scenario would only spend 0.6% of its revenue on 13F  filings a year, while a $1 billion firm would only spend 0.3% of revenue  on 13F filings a year, and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Given the technological advancements implemented by the SEC such as XBRL  and automation, it's easier and cheaper than ever to submit a 13F.&nbsp; Filings are straightforward and not time consuming.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>2)&nbsp; It's Hard To Front-Run Someone 6 Weeks Later</b>&nbsp; <br /><br />The proposal argues that there are also \"indirect costs faced by smaller  managers, such as those associated with potential front-running.\"<br /><br />A frontrunner is defined as: one who trades \u201cin front of an expected  trade by another investor, thereby making the same trade on the terms  the other investor would otherwise have got.\u201d&nbsp;<br /><br />13Fs are filed with the SEC 45 days after quarter-end.&nbsp; It's hard to  front-run someone if you're receiving the information of their actions  six weeks later.&nbsp; This argument does not hold weight and would only  apply to unique situations such as illiquid shares.&nbsp; The  time-delayed reporting of holdings via 13F filing already nullifies the  vast majority of any potential front-running. <br /><br /><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>3)&nbsp; Negative Consequences for Smaller Managers</b><br /><br />The SEC  must also consider the negative ramifications for smaller managers who  would no longer file 13Fs.&nbsp; Many limited partners utilize 13Fs to  corroborate portfolio level details of managers they're invested in.&nbsp;  This  helps prevent another Madoff situation and furthers transparency.<br /><br />It would also reduce small manager discovery.&nbsp; One institutional allocator told us that under the  proposal, it would be increasingly difficult for them to consider  investing in smaller managers due to the lack of transparency that  otherwise aides in monitoring of potential  managers to allocate capital to.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>4)&nbsp; Drastically Reduces Transparency &amp; Limits Future Academic Research&nbsp;</b><br /><br />The loss of 90% of 13F filers and $2.3 trillion of investment holdings  will drastically reduce market transparency and should be reason enough to reject the proposal.&nbsp; It would also hinder academic research about markets and securities.&nbsp;  In a world that's becoming more data-driven by the day, going in the  opposite direction is not progress.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>5)&nbsp; Capital Formation Exists in Current Setup</b><br /><br />An argument can be made that the fact that X respected investor  invests in Y stock leads to capital formation because other investors  are then more inclined to examine and potentially invest in a company  they might otherwise not have known about or bothered to look at.&nbsp; This is particularly the case in small caps, where there's less sell-side coverage and less eyeballs on the companies in general.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So capital formation can be achieved in the current structure <i>because</i> these managers are disclosing stakes in said companies. And again, due  to the 45-day lag for disclosure, they are insulated from  front-running.</p><p>And as far as we're aware, most investors want other people to be interested in and to buy the stocks they've already built stakes in.&nbsp; Increased demand can lead to an increase in share price, thus benefiting the investor that already built a position, not burden them with increased costs as the proposal suggests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Idea sharing will happen regardless of the proposal or not via idea  dinners, conferences, passing around quarterly letters, instant/direct messages, email, word of  mouth, etc.&nbsp; Humans by nature are mimetic beings. <br /><br /><br /><br /><b>6)&nbsp; Investors &amp; Companies Won't Know The Shareholder Base; Public Companies Will See Increased Costs &amp; Time</b><br /><br />Removing 90% of 13F filers drastically reduces the data available to companies as to who their shareholder base is, <i>especially</i> in small and mid cap names.&nbsp; While major holders are revealed via 13D,  13G, and Form 4 filings, the rest of the shareholder base would become  opaque.<br /><br />When asked if the proposal would result in increased costs and time for  their publicly traded company, one head of investor relations at a small  cap replied, \"Definitely.\"&nbsp;<br /><br />They also noted they're \"not entirely sure how to prove who is actually a  (share)holder\" for companies that don't pay a dividend, while companies  that do pay one can glean some potential insight.<br /><br />Another investor relations professional said that the proposal would add costs for their company each year because they'll have to pay a  firm to analyze trading activity in their shares to figure out the rest  of the shareholder base.&nbsp; And even then, this data wouldn't be accurate or even complete.<br /><br />Investors also often want to know who their fellow shareholders  are, particularly when it comes to hedge fund 'crowding.'</p><p>Also, the National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI) <a href=\"https://www.niri.org/NIRI/media/NIRI/Advocacy/NIRI_13F_Joint_Issuer_Letter_SEC_Final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">submitted a letter</a> on behalf of 237 publicly traded companies, 26 investor relations consulting firms, and five industry associations.&nbsp; All of them oppose the SEC's proposal.&nbsp; This includes the likes of Sherwin-Williams, Mastercard, Chipotle, FedEx, Procter &amp; Gamble, Marriott, Delta Air Lines, among many others.</p><p>Lastly, the NYSE along with 381 undersigned public companies also <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7797941-223589.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">sent a letter</a> opposing the proposal.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>7)&nbsp; Commissioner Allison Herren Lee Opposes the Proposal</b><br /><br />Via a statement published on the SEC's website <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-13f-reporting-2020-07-10\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, she writes:</p><p>\"I am concerned that the projected cost savings in today\u2019s proposal are greatly overstated and wholly inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s past analysis\u2014and, importantly, that the actual cost savings do not justify the loss of visibility into portfolios controlling $2.3 trillion in assets. Additionally, the Commission\u2019s assertion of authority to raise the threshold conflicts with the plain text in the Exchange Act that requires us to collect the information.

First, to  create a central repository of historical and current data about the  investment activities of institutional investment managers.&nbsp; Second, to  improve the body of factual data available regarding the holdings of  institutional investment managers and thus facilitate consideration of  the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the  securities markets and the public policy implications of that  influence.&nbsp; Third, to increase investor confidence in the integrity of  the U.S. securities markets.\"<br /><br />A higher reporting threshold resulting in a drastic reduction in the  amount of data does not 'improve the body of factual data.'&nbsp; It does the exact  opposite.&nbsp; Reduced transparency as a result of the proposal would  decrease investor confidence, not increase it as the original goal  states.&nbsp; And the repository of historical data would be severely impaired  going forward.<br /><br />The SEC's own website <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/about.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">lists</a> its mission as:&nbsp; \"The mission of the SEC is to protect investors; maintain  fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation.

By conducting expert surveys through specialist firms, investment managers can reach a greater number of professionals in a fraction of the time, and collect reliable data they can use to form the basis of their investment decisions.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Accessing expert networks has, historically, been a manual and onerous process. Managers would typically make calls to experts in their network, which, though effective at providing direct insight, can be limiting. There are so many hours a manager can dedicate to making these calls and their outreach to experts is also limited by their personal contact book.</p>\n<p>This capability can be broadened, deepened and scaled by conducting surveys through a firm like NewtonX.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is technology that has allowed us to conduct these expert surveys. It is our key differentiator,\u201d explains Khang Nguyen, \u00a0Head of Content and Compliance at NewtonX. Founded by two former McKinsey consultants, the firm supports investment managers making use of fundamental research. Using a vast array of methodologies \u2013 from expert surveys to \u00a0more traditional expert interviews \u2013 NewtonX finds the right qualified experts, conducts targeted surveys, and arranges 1:1 expert interviews.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In particular, the survey capability allows investment managers to move beyond the traditional approach of making between five and 10 calls as part of their research process and instead, tap into a much larger sample of knowledge and insight. By providing expert surveys, the firm helps investment managers get an edge in their decision-making by delivering primary research insights at scale.</p>\n<p>Managers use these surveys to gather information about specific companies they either are investing in or plan to invest in. They also use these research methods for scoping out competitors or to confirm an investment thesis they are already confident in.</p>\n<p>The expert networks most investment managers currently use are manual in nature. When quantitative research methods are used, managers often are not fully cognisant of whether the respondents are qualified to be answering the questions posed to them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a proprietary search engine which is based on machine learning, AI and structured data which identifies qualified experts for a survey. It focuses not only on ensuring the right people are targeted in terms of qualifications and job titles but it also finds decision-makers in the client\u2019s chosen area of focus,\u201d Nguyen explains.</p>\n<p>Newton X uses AI and ML to drive better search results, allowing the company to identify experts that have the knowledge, experience, and expertise that investors are looking for, things that are not apparent from a job title or resume. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Through this, NewtonX is able to offer access to niche and difficult-to-access networks. And the system provides 100% ID verified respondents to make sure the respondents really are who they say they are. This means managers can be assured the data they are collecting is reliable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The technology deployed by NewtonX also means the survey results can be further analysed. The main reason is for getting deeper, richer insights by mixing methodologies with the firm\u2019s Qual-Quant-Qual approach. An example of this is if any experts responded unexpectedly, the firm can reach out to them to better understand their reasoning. \u201cThe tools we use allow us to identify outliers very easily and it is those differences which managers are looking for. The data from those outliers can provide a competitive advantage and this is a service NewtonX provides, which no other company is currently able to offer.</p>\n<p>\u201cCurrently all our work is bespoke, but clients ask many questions which are often universal,\u201d he says, \u201cso we are looking to provide access to that base level of information which could, potentially, answer 80% of a client\u2019s initial questions. Then they can request follow ups for more specific questions to get into further detail.\u201d</p>\n<p>As a result, managers can get large swathes of information a lot faster and then dive deeper into areas where they need additional information.</p>\n<p><strong>Visualising results</strong></p>\n<p>Data visualisation is \u201cessential for exploratory data analysis\u201d. As investment professionals are often time constrained, having access to information which is instantly understandable can elevate their decision-making capabilities.</p>\n<p>NewtonX is seeking to support this by exploring ways to incorporate more data visualisations within the surveys it conducts. \u201cRight now, survey providers deliver the final output as CSV or - at best excel - requiring clients to manipulate excel to allow them to analyse information; they should be concentrating on what the best investment opportunity is within that data,\u201d Nguyen observes, \u201cworking on a way to help them visualize the data more easily, so it can take 10 or 15 minutes to digest.

It argues that smaller managers that would  no longer file 13Fs would save direct compliance costs that \"could  range from $15,000 to $30,000 annually per manager.\"<br /><br />One hedge fund told us that <i>at worst</i>  they see around $3,500 in costs per quarter to file a 13F, or around  $14,000 per year, just below the low-end of the SEC's estimates.&nbsp;  Another hedge fund noted that costs and time associated with filing 13Fs  are negligible.&nbsp; Any 'relief' that would fall to smaller managers is de minimis, at best.&nbsp;<br /><br />Examining a hypothetical scenario of firms currently most impacted  showcases this: a firm managing $100 million with only a 1% management  fee and no performance fee theoretically earns $1 million in revenue a year.&nbsp; Taking  the SEC's highest estimate of yearly filing costs ($30,000) and dividing  that by the firm's hypothetical yearly revenue ($1 million) means that  annual filing costs would be only 3% of revenue. <br /><br />And using the SEC's own estimates, that's <i>the worst</i> case scenario  since it's the smallest firm required to file a 13F.&nbsp; A $500 million  firm in the same scenario would only spend 0.6% of its revenue on 13F  filings a year, while a $1 billion firm would only spend 0.3% of revenue  on 13F filings a year, and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Given the technological advancements implemented by the SEC such as XBRL  and automation, it's easier and cheaper than ever to submit a 13F.&nbsp; Filings are straightforward and not time consuming.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>2)&nbsp; It's Hard To Front-Run Someone 6 Weeks Later</b>&nbsp; <br /><br />The proposal argues that there are also \"indirect costs faced by smaller  managers, such as those associated with potential front-running.\"<br /><br />A frontrunner is defined as: one who trades \u201cin front of an expected  trade by another investor, thereby making the same trade on the terms  the other investor would otherwise have got.\u201d&nbsp;<br /><br />13Fs are filed with the SEC 45 days after quarter-end.&nbsp; It's hard to  front-run someone if you're receiving the information of their actions  six weeks later.&nbsp; This argument does not hold weight and would only  apply to unique situations such as illiquid shares.&nbsp; The  time-delayed reporting of holdings via 13F filing already nullifies the  vast majority of any potential front-running. <br /><br /><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>3)&nbsp; Negative Consequences for Smaller Managers</b><br /><br />The SEC  must also consider the negative ramifications for smaller managers who  would no longer file 13Fs.&nbsp; Many limited partners utilize 13Fs to  corroborate portfolio level details of managers they're invested in.&nbsp;  This  helps prevent another Madoff situation and furthers transparency.<br /><br />It would also reduce small manager discovery.&nbsp; One institutional allocator told us that under the  proposal, it would be increasingly difficult for them to consider  investing in smaller managers due to the lack of transparency that  otherwise aides in monitoring of potential  managers to allocate capital to.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>4)&nbsp; Drastically Reduces Transparency &amp; Limits Future Academic Research&nbsp;</b><br /><br />The loss of 90% of 13F filers and $2.3 trillion of investment holdings  will drastically reduce market transparency and should be reason enough to reject the proposal.&nbsp; It would also hinder academic research about markets and securities.&nbsp;  In a world that's becoming more data-driven by the day, going in the  opposite direction is not progress.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>5)&nbsp; Capital Formation Exists in Current Setup</b><br /><br />An argument can be made that the fact that X respected investor  invests in Y stock leads to capital formation because other investors  are then more inclined to examine and potentially invest in a company  they might otherwise not have known about or bothered to look at.&nbsp; This is particularly the case in small caps, where there's less sell-side coverage and less eyeballs on the companies in general.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So capital formation can be achieved in the current structure <i>because</i> these managers are disclosing stakes in said companies. And again, due  to the 45-day lag for disclosure, they are insulated from  front-running.</p><p>And as far as we're aware, most investors want other people to be interested in and to buy the stocks they've already built stakes in.&nbsp; Increased demand can lead to an increase in share price, thus benefiting the investor that already built a position, not burden them with increased costs as the proposal suggests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Idea sharing will happen regardless of the proposal or not via idea  dinners, conferences, passing around quarterly letters, instant/direct messages, email, word of  mouth, etc.&nbsp; Humans by nature are mimetic beings. <br /><br /><br /><br /><b>6)&nbsp; Investors &amp; Companies Won't Know The Shareholder Base; Public Companies Will See Increased Costs &amp; Time</b><br /><br />Removing 90% of 13F filers drastically reduces the data available to companies as to who their shareholder base is, <i>especially</i> in small and mid cap names.&nbsp; While major holders are revealed via 13D,  13G, and Form 4 filings, the rest of the shareholder base would become  opaque.<br /><br />When asked if the proposal would result in increased costs and time for  their publicly traded company, one head of investor relations at a small  cap replied, \"Definitely.\"&nbsp;<br /><br />They also noted they're \"not entirely sure how to prove who is actually a  (share)holder\" for companies that don't pay a dividend, while companies  that do pay one can glean some potential insight.<br /><br />Another investor relations professional said that the proposal would add costs for their company each year because they'll have to pay a  firm to analyze trading activity in their shares to figure out the rest  of the shareholder base.&nbsp; And even then, this data wouldn't be accurate or even complete.<br /><br />Investors also often want to know who their fellow shareholders  are, particularly when it comes to hedge fund 'crowding.'</p><p>Also, the National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI) <a href=\"https://www.niri.org/NIRI/media/NIRI/Advocacy/NIRI_13F_Joint_Issuer_Letter_SEC_Final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">submitted a letter</a> on behalf of 237 publicly traded companies, 26 investor relations consulting firms, and five industry associations.&nbsp; All of them oppose the SEC's proposal.&nbsp; This includes the likes of Sherwin-Williams, Mastercard, Chipotle, FedEx, Procter &amp; Gamble, Marriott, Delta Air Lines, among many others.</p><p>Lastly, the NYSE along with 381 undersigned public companies also <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-20/s70820-7797941-223589.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">sent a letter</a> opposing the proposal.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>7)&nbsp; Commissioner Allison Herren Lee Opposes the Proposal</b><br /><br />Via a statement published on the SEC's website <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-13f-reporting-2020-07-10\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, she writes:</p><p>\"I am concerned that the projected cost savings in today\u2019s proposal are greatly overstated and wholly inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s past analysis\u2014and, importantly, that the actual cost savings do not justify the loss of visibility into portfolios controlling $2.3 trillion in assets.

First, to  create a central repository of historical and current data about the  investment activities of institutional investment managers.&nbsp; Second, to  improve the body of factual data available regarding the holdings of  institutional investment managers and thus facilitate consideration of  the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the  securities markets and the public policy implications of that  influence.&nbsp; Third, to increase investor confidence in the integrity of  the U.S. securities markets.\"<br /><br />A higher reporting threshold resulting in a drastic reduction in the  amount of data does not 'improve the body of factual data.'&nbsp; It does the exact  opposite.&nbsp; Reduced transparency as a result of the proposal would  decrease investor confidence, not increase it as the original goal  states.&nbsp; And the repository of historical data would be severely impaired  going forward.<br /><br />The SEC's own website <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/about.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">lists</a> its mission as:&nbsp; \"The mission of the SEC is to protect investors; maintain  fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation.  The SEC strives to promote a market environment that is worthy of the  public's trust.\"<br /><br />The proposal severely reduces transparency, which does <i>not </i>protect investors.&nbsp; Such reduced transparency also erodes the environment of public trust that the SEC aims to achieve.<br /><br />If the SEC is deadset on raising the filing threshold for the sake of modernization or to reduce its own burden, utilizing the inflation metric and setting the threshold at  ~$500 million would reduce the number of filers by 50% (thus reducing  any burdens on both the SEC &amp; the smallest managers) while  maintaining more transparency.&nbsp; The poll above also shows this is more  palatable than the proposal's $3.5 billion threshold.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simply put though, the negatives associated with the proposal greatly outweigh any perceived positives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">How to Provide Feedback to the SEC</span></p><p><b>The SEC is seeking input on the proposal and the deadline for comment is tomorrow (September 29th)</b>.&nbsp;

First, to  create a central repository of historical and current data about the  investment activities of institutional investment managers.&nbsp; Second, to  improve the body of factual data available regarding the holdings of  institutional investment managers and thus facilitate consideration of  the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the  securities markets and the public policy implications of that  influence.&nbsp; Third, to increase investor confidence in the integrity of  the U.S. securities markets.\"<br /><br />A higher reporting threshold resulting in a drastic reduction in the  amount of data does not 'improve the body of factual data.'&nbsp; It does the exact  opposite.&nbsp; Reduced transparency as a result of the proposal would  decrease investor confidence, not increase it as the original goal  states.&nbsp; And the repository of historical data would be severely impaired  going forward.<br /><br />The SEC's own website <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/about.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">lists</a> its mission as:&nbsp; \"The mission of the SEC is to protect investors; maintain  fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation.

One of these key pressures is data-related, due to the fragmentation which still exists in this part of the market. Uniting datasets in one place can prove to be a very powerful tool for managers looking to make an impact in the ESG arena. More broadly, the market volatility has underlined the need for modern research management and financial research software.</strong></em></p>\n<p>\u201cFunds source and monitor ESG ratings from several 3rd party data providers but need to be able to review and monitor those datapoints in context with one another,\u201d outlines Andrew Robson, CEO, Verity, \u201cWe help them unite those datasets in one place with, for example, integrations with Sustainalytics, and others.\u201d</p>\n<p>Verity won the 2022 Hedgeweek US Award for Best Data Provider \u2013 Overall.</p>\n<p>Robson details another challenge in relation to ESG and data: \u201cThis is related to ESG engagement tracking and reporting. It\u2019s a matter of time before funds must disclose how sustainable they are. In July, we released VerityESG, a reporting and engagement tracker that gives asset managers an efficient way to build their engagement narrative and prove stewardship.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is particularly relevant given the growing need for funds to prove stewardship by tracking and reporting on engagements. Robson comments: \u201cUp until recently, these activities have been managed manually. It\u2019s slow and time intensive. As regulators in the U.S. are catching up, funds are realising they need to formalise how they tackle this.\u201d</p>\n<p>The VerityESG tool was launched specifically to help funds automate and streamline engagement tracking and reporting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The data provider also supports managers in tackling the ongoing talent wars and cementing of the new hybrid workplace.</p>\n<p>Robson comments: \u201cMany financial services IT and business decision-makers expect more than half of their workforce to reman hybrid after the pandemic. Further, most financial services business decision-makers believe hybrid work environments help them recruit top talent and remain competitive in the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFunds can\u2019t miss a step. Our cloud-based and mobile-friendly research management software enable funds to hire talent where it lives and then keep their teams connected \u2014 whether they are in New York City, Chicago, or Tokyo. In addition, a research management system that stores all a fund\u2019s research accelerates onboarding of incoming talent and protects against potential IP losses when talent leaves.\u201d</p>\n<p>While the volatility over the past year has had major impacts on markets, Verity\u2019s clients still must develop winning investment ideas and do so as quickly and efficiently as possible. In many ways, the fluidity of the current moment has only elevated the need for modern research management and financial research software, both of which help fund improve performance and build market resiliency.\u00a0</p>\n<hr /><p><span style=\"display: block; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #313131; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20px;\"><strong><img align=\"left\" alt=\"\" height=\"150\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/sites/default/files/Verity_Andrew_Robson_Index.png\" style=\"float: left;\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"150\" /></strong></span><em><strong> Andrew Robson, CEO, Verity</strong></em></span></p>\n\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-newsletter-signup field-label-hidden\">\n              <div class=\"field-item\">Like this article?
